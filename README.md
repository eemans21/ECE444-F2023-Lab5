# Pros & Cons of TDD
Pro of Test-Driven Development (TDD): TDD significantly improves code quality by enforcing clean, modular code and early bug detection. With tests written first, developers are prompted to think about design and architecture before writing code, resulting in a more maintainable and bug-resistant codebase.

Con of Test-Driven Development (TDD): TDD can introduce initial time overhead, slowing down development progress, and may not be suitable for all projects. It requires a learning curve and can lead to test fragility, where frequent test updates are necessary, increasing maintenance efforts and potentially resisting changes to established workflows.
